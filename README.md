# Social Media Feed with Infinite Scroll

This project is a full-stack web application that simulates a social media feed where users can continuously scroll, with new media content loading infinitely.

## Features

- **Infinite Scroll**: Users can scroll through the feed, and new media is loaded automatically as they reach the bottom of the page.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and responsive UI for seamless browsing across devices.
- **Real-Time Content Loading**: Media is dynamically fetched from the server without the need for a full page refresh.
